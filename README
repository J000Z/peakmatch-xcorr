Peak-matched sampled efficient cross-correlation of time series
---------------------------------------------------------------



process:
- create two directories, for full and sample datasets
- put all events into full 
- take small (~500-1000) random sample from full into sample
 	(ls /path/to/full | shuf | head -500 | xargs -I xx cp /path/to/full/xx /path/to/sample)

- edit xcorr.conf, add locations of dataset directories

- initial parameter refinement: first set mode=ANALYSE, run, observe output

- change parameter in config file until performance / accuracy tradeoff is acceptable

- set mode=PEAKMATCH, run

- set mode=POSTPROCESS, run

compilation:
mvn assembly:single

usage:
java -Xmx2G -jar target/peakmatch-jar-with-dependencies.jar

(change 2G (2Gb) in -Xmx2G to whatever memory limits you want to give the process)
